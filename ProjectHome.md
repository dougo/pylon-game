[Pylon](http://www.icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Pylon) is an abstract strategy game originally designed to be played with Icehouse pyramids.  The pylon-game project is a home for online implementations of the game.  The first implementation is for [Volity](http://volity.net/games/gamefinder/ruleset.html?uri=http://steak.place.org/games/pylon/ruleset.html).  The game module is implemented in Python and the UI module is implemented in SVG and ECMAScript.
