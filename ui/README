This UI module has been tested with Volity Gamut 0.4.1.  By default,
when Gamut connects to a Pylon game table, it will download the UI
module from the location registered with the Volity bookkeeper, but
you can have it load your local copy if you prefer.  Use the "Game" ->
"Select New Interface..." menu option to bring up the UI selection
dialog, and click the "Select File..." or "Enter URL..." buttons.  See
the Volity home page for more information: http://volity.net/

This UI module supports the basic Pylon ruleset:
