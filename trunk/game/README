This game module has been tested with the most recent volityd.py as of
2008-03-10.  You should run volity.py with the following configuration options:

game: pylon.Game
bot: pylon.RandomBot
admin: webadmin@volity.net
restart-script: volityd.py

You'll also need to supply values for jid, password, contact-jid, and
contact-email.  You can put all of these options in the file "config"
and run the parlor as follows:

volityd.py --config config

Make sure both volityd.py and pylon.py are on your PYTHONPATH.

This game module supports the basic Pylon ruleset:
